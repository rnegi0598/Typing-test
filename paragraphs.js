"A talkative turtle called Tom lived in a lake deep inside a forest. He would talk all day long with anyone- from tiny ants to giant elephants. But Tom liked to talk most with his best friends-a pair of geese called Bo and Mo. The three friends lived in the same lake.One day, they noticed that the water in the lake was drying up. Many animals in the forest were leaving the forest in search of water. Bo and Mo decided to leave too. With a heavy heart, they came to say goodbye to Tom.We just have to find a sturdy log of wood. You hold the log with your beaks and fly. I will hold on to the wood with my mouth. That way we can all leave together.The three friends left the next morning. Tom was excited. He had lived all his life on the ground. Now he could see mountains from a height. Even the tall elephants looked tiny from the sky. He wanted to discuss all this with his friends. But remembering words, he kept his mouth shut.But the moment he opened his mouth, he dropped straight to the ground. He hit his head on a rock and fell unconscious.",

The King immediately agreed. As soon as he stepped in, the King and Queen, followed by the soldiers, rushed in.

"There was a large banyan tree deep inside a dense forest. Its branches spread in all directions, throwing a large shade on the ground. The branches were full of leaves, which rustled when the wind blew. One day, Guru the crow, landed on one of the branches. It was a hot summer day, and Guru enjoyed the cool breeze on the banyan tree.He looked around, but was surprised to see no nests on such a majestic, friendly tree. He couldn't hear the squeaking of the squirrels, the shrill cry of the mynahs or the twittering of sparrows. It was strange, but Guru found the tree silent and peaceful.The next day he brought his wife Mia to the tree. The two crows lovingly built a nest on one of the thick branches of the tree. The two loved their new home.A few months later, Mia laid four eggs. After some time, four crow chicks hatched from the eggs. Guru and Mia were extremely happy. They flew the next day to find some juicy worms for the hungry chicks. But when they returned in the evening, they found the babies missing.",
"Lallu, the crocodile was bored. He was looking for friends to play with. He found none. Then, he spotted an elephant wading into a stream.It was hot. Gajju, the elephant wanted to splash water on his back. He sucked water into his trunk and poured it down over his back.Lallu was puzzled. He meant no harm, he was only pulling the elephant's leg playfully. Why was he howling?Mangu, the monkey was watching the drama in the stream from where he was sitting- atop a mango tree. He could see that Gajju was in pain. He thought he should do something. He picked up a huge mango and threw it at the crocodile.Lallu saw from the corner of his eyes, a big red mango heading towards him. He always wanted to taste a mango. He had even tried once to climb a mango tree nearby but gave it up as he slipped down. Now, here was a mango! He jumped high and caught the mango in his jaws!Gajju, relieved that the croc had released his leg, left the stream in a hurry. He gave an elephant salute to monkey and departed in a hurry. Mangu watched the crocodile crunching the mango.",

He thought that the maid had changed into a monkey! Just then, the maid walked in, looked at the monkey with the fan in his hand. Shrieking loudly, she ran out of the room.The monkey grinned. Moocha Raja laughed.He took a liking to the monkey at once. The monkey appeared to be his soul mate! Moocha Raja, overcome by love for his soul mate, threw him a banana which the monkey smartly caught.Later, when Moocha Raja dressed up to leave for the court, the monkey ran and brought him his shoes. Moocha Raja patted him and threw him a mango, which the monkey accepted with glee.Moocha Raja called the royal tailor and asked him to stitch a pant and a coat for the monkey.

"The monkey appeared to be his soul mate! Moocha Raja, overcome by love for his soul mate, threw him a banana which the monkey smartly caught.The minister shut his mouth and withdrew.That afternoon, Moocha Raja took a nap. The monkey sat beside him with the fan. He saw a fly coming into the room through the window. The monkey eyed this fly suspiciously. The fly ignored the monkey and buzzed towards the sleeping king. The monkey shooed him away with the fan in his hand. But the fly was not easily put off. He came again buzzing. The monkey chased him away, only to find him buzzing above the sleeping king.As though to defy the monkey, the fly sat on the nose of Moocha Raja. Now the furious monkey raised his fist, and brought it down hard on the fly. The fly flew away just in time. But Moocha Raja jumped in pain, holding his broken and bleeding nose.Alarmed at the sight of the blood, the monkey jumped out of the window, never to be seen again. Much to the relief of his people, Moocha Raja stayed away from them until his nose had healed!",

Someone whispered, “That's the school inspector, Mr Giles.” The boys were nervous. They were afraid of inspection. Just then the school bell rang. It was a signal for all students to go to their classes. The English teacher was nervous. He would be blamed if the boys made too many mistakes. He went around the class as the boys got busy writing the words on the slate. The teacher stopped at a desk. A boy named Mohandas was writing, trying hard to get the spellings right.`
